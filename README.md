# Bad-Kern

This is a bookmarklet for adding horrible kerning to a desired &lt;p&gt; tag on a web page.

It's a joke bookmarklet made after I was forwared [this site](https://hellveticafont.com/) and I decided to spread the cheer around.

You can find the bookmarklet over at http://bad-kern.netlify.com/

# Bookmarklets

It is not very often used these days, so for those unaware, a bookmarklet is a snippet of JS that is executed in the URL via the `javascript` prefix. This can be inserted into an &lt;a&gt; tag or into a bookmark.

Once in a bookmark, this snippet can be executed on any page, hence the name.
