  <h1>This is a joke bookmarklet</h1>
  <p>After being directed to <a href="https://hellveticafont.com/">this site over here</a>, I was inspired to whip up a quick bookmarklet to do this horrible atrocity to any paragraph of your choosing.</p>
  <p>This bookmarklet works by targeting all &lt;p&gt; tags on a page and, if granted permission, randomly changes the margin on each character in a word, excluding the first and last letter.</p>
  <div class="bookmarklet-container">
    <a class="bookmarklet">Bad Kern A Paragraph</a>
  </div>
  <p>You can drag that button/link to the navbar in order to activate it later, or click it now to see its effects on this page.</p>
